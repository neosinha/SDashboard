# SDashboard
A simple javascript based framework for dashboards. 

Have you been in a situation where you needed to build a UI but have been dragged into learning some big framework or some new technology completely? As a technology enthusiast, UI is just a part of what I need to do. It is a very important one though, as it is the tool by which users consume the technology or application.
I have found myself juggling between iOS/Java/HTML/Angular and different types of HTML frameworks. There are a lot of frameworks which produce responsive web-pages and are mobile ready. However, only a few come close to Bootstrap. This framework is really simple, complete and very well supported. 
However workign with raw bootstrap, I find myself struggling to keep up with layout and alignment changes too early in the app design process. This significantly slows down the progress. I just found it very difficult to keep writing regular HTML or just remembering the bootstrap classes or structure. 
Almost all frameworks suffer from the "class" blow-up problem, making you keep the documentation page open always. 

One of my requirements is that the UI Framework needs to have a programatic support. JqueryMobile comes close but the CSS manipulations slow the framework down. I could not find one that suited my needs and hence, I started on a journey. I hope that others would find this project useful. 

Simple Dashboard UI Framework,
1. Sits on top Bootstap Framework 
2. brings the power of DOM manipulations to Javascript/TypeScript to very fast UI implementations. 
3. It does not ask you to write HTML which is then processed through CSS or Javascript. 
4. would still allow you to overide CSS Elements 
5. would allow you to add your own custom elements.

At present a few UI elements have been developed but the list is growing rapidly. 

Example: The main app would be derived from a boiler-plate code(which can be extended),  


That's it.. Use your time in developing views or custom elements without writing HTML
